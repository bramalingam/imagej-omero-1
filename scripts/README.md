Here are some example ImageJ scripts for use with ImageJ-OMERO.

Create a `$OMERO_PREFIX/lib/ImageJ.app/scripts/Scripts` folder and place them
in there. Then re-run `gen-scripts` in ImageJ's `lib` directory to add them
to your OMERO installation.

Please note that some of these scripts are not yet functional with the current
beta version of the bindings.
