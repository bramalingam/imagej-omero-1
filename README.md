This repository contains code for interoperability between
[ImageJ](http://developer.imagej.net/) and the
[OMERO server](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/).

This project includes an interoperability layer which enables OMERO servers to
query and execute ImageJ commands on the server side as OMERO scripts.
