This repository contains code for interoperability between
[ImageJ](http://developer.imagej.net/) and the
[OMERO server](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/).

The `server` project enables execution of ImageJ commands as OMERO scripts from
the server side.

In the future, we may also develop one or more `client` projects which provide
ImageJ commands for remote communication with OMERO.
